			<h3>Early Game</h3>
			<span>
				You are now in the game and you can see two buttons: Dilaters and Compressors<br>
				Dilaters multiply Time Speed but at the cost of resetting Production<br>
				Compressors increase the duration of Production but at the cost of resetting Production and Dilaters<br>
				Start off by getting a Dilater, then get a Compressor, then get another Dilater<br>
				As you can see you will start to generate Points, but the unit is ε?<br>
				ε is a quantity that means infinitely small or 1/∞ in the hyper-real numbers<br>
				10% of your Points are lost every second which is negligeble<br>
				Another resource is being generated: Tuons<br>
				Tuons are the bane of your production as it divides Time Speed and boosts its own gain<br>
				Just do a Dilater reset then Compressor reset if you can until you unlock the next layer

			<h3>Limits</h3>
			<span>
				This is still being worked on
